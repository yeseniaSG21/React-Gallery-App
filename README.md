# React-Gallery-App

This project uses the very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app. With the help of the powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app will be built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.
* Images in 'Mockup-Images' shows examples of how the app will look when users get a result or not. 
* Adjusted CSS styling by changing color and picture borders, as well as adding an image to "NotFound.js".

This project:

* Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
* Used React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
* Used the tool, Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and use it to display images in your app.
* Added logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
* Added to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
* Expanded my knowledge and practice of React.

## To Start Project:
* Run npm start in terminal and open http://localhost:3000 to view in browser.
